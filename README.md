# Webscraping News

This repository is a part of the large project aimed to collect and understanding diverse media on the Russia-Ukraine war. 

To this end, I have scraped news articles with Ukraine (or Ukrain*) query from January 2022 to July 2023 from both Russian and Western sources. 

You can see them in the table below.
